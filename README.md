# Multi-Proxy, Multi-Season Streamflow Reconstruction with Mass Balance Adjustment

Data and code to reproduce the entitled paper (Nguyen et al, 2020).

Download the repo as a `zip` file and extract it to your working folder. If you use RStudio, open the file `multi-proxy-mbr.Rproj` to set up the project environment. Otherwise, you can set up your working folder manually.

We encourage you to first open the file `multiproxy-mbr.html` to read through the analysis steps and corresponding results.

To reproduce the results, you can then open the file `multiproxy-mbr.Rmd` and follow the steps. The file `R/init.R` lists the necessary packages, so you may want to install them before running the code.
